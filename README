
This file contains last minute updates for Sid & Al's Incredible Toons.

We have discovered that video cards with a TSENG chip set may cause
the screen to flash when the program is running.  If this
happens you will need to add the following line to the RESOURCE.CFG
file in the TOONS directory:
        VIDEO = YES

This line will instruct the program that the video card is present
and prevent the screen from flashing.
